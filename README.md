DDConvexHull
============

A Convex Hull plug-in for Maya based on StanHull.  The hard work credit goes to Stan Melax and John Ratcliff for providing the open source code that actually does the convex hull.

The code should compile without issue on Windows, as it was ported from Windows to compile on OSX.
